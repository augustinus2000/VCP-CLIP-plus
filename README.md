# VCP-CLIP+

This repository provides the official implementation of VCP-CLIP+,  
an improved variant of VCP-CLIP that stabilizes training and optimizes performance with minimal architectural changes.

> 📌 The corresponding paper (VCP-CLIP+: Stabilizing and Optimizing VCP-CLIP with Minimal Architectural Changes) is currently **under review**.  
> Therefore, **0--abstract, detailed method description, and experimental results are intentionally omitted** from this repository.  
> This repo focuses on the **code**, a minimal set of **pretrained weights**, and **instructions to reproduce training & inference**.
